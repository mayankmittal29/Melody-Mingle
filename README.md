As creators of the website:

	- we have took into consideration the UI/UX of the website at each & every step while building it from scratch
		
	- we have managed to keep the website truly vibrant & colorful while also keeping it decent enough by not over-doing any of the effects
	
	- we tried to keep the text sizes as much "OPTIMAL" as possible on all pages in order to make it a good reading experience for the users
	
	- even smallest shades of color contrasts have been considered by us leading to being very picky about the background accents & images for all pages
	
	- we have kept the footer such that it is clearly visible commonly on all the pages while at the same time, does not attract too much of attention
	
	- selection of fonts has been a very generic choice that would suit the mass rather than being a personal choice by any of us
	
	- sizes of different sections, divisions & images were well-thought over by both of us such that it provides a good User Experience (UX)
	
	- User Interface (UI) has been kept as simple as possible rather than making it too fancy or complex so that it appeals to all categories of users
	
	
	
How to access the website for evaluations ?

	- In order to open the Home page of the website, you need to run the HTML file named as FirstPage.html in the  "src/" folder on any brwoser of your choice
	
	- As soon as you open the FirstPage, from there , you can either login or signup into the page or directly go to EXPLORE NOW which redirects you to BeatStreets Homepage , also you can go to ABOUT to read about the founders of BeatStreet.	
    
    -Just take into consideration that while logging in you need to put username:Doab and password:12345 in order of successfully enter into the homepage. Whereas for simplification Explore button can be use for opening the Home Page.

	- The inter-connection of pages has been already established within the HTML scripts of all the pages

    -Most important point to notice is that BeatStreet can be only viewed beautifully at 1920x1080 pixels.
