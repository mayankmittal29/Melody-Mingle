## 👨‍💻 As the Creator of the Website:

- I have taken into consideration the UI/UX of the website at each and every step while building it from scratch.
- I have managed to keep the website truly vibrant and colorful while also keeping it decent enough by not over-doing any of the effects.
- I tried to keep the text sizes as much "OPTIMAL" as possible on all pages in order to make it a good reading experience for the users.
- Even the smallest shades of color contrasts have been considered, leading to being very picky about the background accents and images for all pages.
- I have kept the footer such that it is clearly visible commonly on all the pages while at the same time, does not attract too much attention.
- The selection of fonts has been a very generic choice that would suit the mass rather than being a personal choice.
- Sizes of different sections, divisions, and images were well-thought such that it provides a good User Experience (UX).
- The User Interface (UI) has been kept as simple as possible rather than making it too fancy or complex so that it appeals to all categories of users.
